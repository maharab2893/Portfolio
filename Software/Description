Wi-Fi Motion Detection Script â€“ Detailed Description

The Wi-Fi Motion Detection Script is a Python-based tool designed to monitor the presence and activity of a device on your Wi-Fi network. By continuously pinging a target device and analyzing the response times, it can detect sudden changes that may indicate motion or activity near the device. The script combines real-time data logging, alert notifications, and live visualization to provide an intuitive and interactive monitoring experience.

Key Features

Real-Time Ping Monitoring

Continuously sends pings to the specified target device.

Measures response time (latency) in milliseconds.

Handles unreachable or timed-out responses gracefully.

Live Visualization

Plots ping delay over time using a dynamic, live-updating graph.

Graph updates every second for a clear, real-time view.

Customizable graph labels and appearance for easy reading.

Motion/Activity Alerts

Detects sudden changes in ping delay based on a configurable threshold.

Alerts appear in the console when a significant change is detected.

Helps identify movement or activity near the monitored device.

Customizable Settings

Target IP address can be easily modified in the script.

Alert threshold is adjustable to match sensitivity requirements.

Logging frequency and display options can be fine-tuned.

Cross-Platform Compatibility

Works seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Automatically adjusts ping command based on the operating system.

Optional Logging & Data Analysis

Optionally uses pandas for structured data logging and further analysis.

Logged data can be saved, exported, and used for trend analysis over time.

Benefits

Non-intrusive Monitoring: No additional hardware needed; monitors devices already on your Wi-Fi network.

Real-Time Insights: Provides immediate feedback about network activity or device presence.

User-Friendly: Console-based alerts plus a live graph for intuitive monitoring.

Flexible & Customizable: Adjust IP, thresholds, and logging to match different scenarios.

Ideal for Home or Small Office: Detect motion, monitor devices, or analyze network performance with minimal setup.

Use Cases

Detect movement near Wi-Fi-enabled devices without cameras.

Monitor the presence of smartphones, laptops, or IoT devices on the network.

Track network performance by visualizing ping delays.

Educational tool for learning about networking, Python programming, and real-time data visualization.
